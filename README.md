# Frontend Fundamentals

Frontend Fundamentals is a collection of foundational HTML and CSS projects designed to build and reinforce core web development skills.

>  This is my **first HTML and CSS project**, learned by following tutorials on **YouTube**.  
>  I'm using this repository to practice writing clean HTML and CSS code, and to build responsive, beginner-friendly layouts.
